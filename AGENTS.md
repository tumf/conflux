# AGENTS.md - Conflux

Essential information for AI coding agents working on this Rust codebase.

## Project Overview

Conflux(cflx) automates the OpenSpec change workflow (list → dependency analysis → apply → acceptance → archive → resolve → merged). It orchestrates `openspec` and AI coding agent tools to process changes autonomously.

## Self-hosted Development

* Find cflx logs: `~/.local/state/cflx/logs/conflux-{slug}/YYYY-MM-DD.log`

## Frontends
Conflux has the following frontends:

* TUI
* WebUI (server mode)

## Web UI

The WebUI provides a dashboard when Conflux runs in server mode.
The dashboard source files are located in the `dashboard/` directory.
The build output (`dashboard/dist/`) is embedded into the Rust binary via `include_str!` at compile time.

## Directories

* `src/`: Main Rust source code
* `tests/`: Rust test code
* `dashboard/`: WebUI dashboard source files
* `web/`: Embedded static web assets used by the Rust application
* `skills/`: Source files for `cflx-*` skills that are embedded into the Rust binary
* `openspec/`: OpenSpec changes and specs
* `docs/`: Project documentation
* `scripts/`: Development and release helper scripts

## Serial or Parallel Mode

* Parallel mode: Mainly used
* Serial mode: Obsolete (to be removed)

## Skills

It also depends on `cflx-*` skills developed under the `skills/` directory.
The skill files are embedded into the Rust binary via `include_str!` at compile time.
**NEVER EDIT** `~/.agents/skills/cflx-*` skills. These will be overwritten by `cflx install-skills --global`.

## Unit Tests

Tests taking over 1 second must either be optimized to run in under 1 second or, if that is not practical, marked with `#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "heavy"), ignore)]`. Heavy tests must not run as part of the default test suite.
