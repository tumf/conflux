## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Parallel execution completion status must accurately reflect actual processing outcome

The system SHALL send completion events and messages only when processing completes normally, not when stopped or cancelled by the user.

The system SHALL distinguish between successful completion, completion with errors, graceful stop, and cancellation.

**Priority**: HIGH
**Rationale**: Incorrect completion messages mislead users about the processing status and can cause confusion when resuming work.

#### Scenario: Graceful stop during parallel execution should not show success message

**Given** the orchestrator is running in parallel mode
**And** at least one change is queued for processing
**When** the user triggers graceful stop (ESC key) before any change completes
**Then** the orchestrator should stop processing
**And** should send `OrchestratorEvent::Stopped`
**And** should NOT send `OrchestratorEvent::AllCompleted`
**And** should NOT display "All parallel changes completed" message
**And** should NOT display "All changes processed successfully" message
**And** should display "Processing stopped" message only

#### Scenario: Force stop (cancel) during parallel execution should not show success message

**Given** the orchestrator is running in parallel mode
**And** at least one change is queued for processing
**When** cancellation is triggered via cancel token
**Then** the orchestrator should immediately stop
**And** should display "Parallel execution cancelled" message
**And** should NOT send `OrchestratorEvent::AllCompleted`
**And** should NOT display any success completion messages

#### Scenario: Successful parallel execution completion shows success message

**Given** the orchestrator is running in parallel mode
**And** multiple changes are queued for processing
**When** all changes complete successfully without errors
**Then** the orchestrator should send `OrchestratorEvent::AllCompleted`
**And** should display "All parallel changes completed" success message
**And** should display "All changes processed successfully" message

#### Scenario: Parallel execution with partial errors shows warning message

**Given** the orchestrator is running in parallel mode
**And** multiple changes are queued for processing
**When** at least one batch fails with an error
**And** the orchestrator continues processing remaining changes
**And** all queued changes have been attempted
**Then** the orchestrator should send `OrchestratorEvent::AllCompleted`
**And** should display "Processing completed with errors" warning message
**And** should NOT display "All changes processed successfully" message

#### Scenario: Stop due to merge stall does not send successful completion

- **GIVEN** parallel execution is running
- **AND** merge stall is detected and cancellation is triggered
- **WHEN** the execution loop stops
- **THEN** `OrchestratorEvent::AllCompleted` is NOT sent
- **AND** the merge stall reason is logged as the stop reason
