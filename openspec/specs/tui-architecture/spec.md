# tui-architecture Specification

## Purpose
Defines the TUI module structure and architectural patterns.
## Requirements
### Requirement: TUI Module Structure

The TUI module SHALL be organized as a directory-based module tree under `src/tui/` with focused submodules. The TUI state layer MUST consume a shared orchestration state model for change progress and execution metadata, while UI-only fields (cursor, view modes, selection state) remain in TUI-owned state. 共有オーケストレーション状態から取り込むイテレーション番号は、既存のTUI表示より小さい値で上書きしてはならない（MUST NOT）。必要に応じてより大きい値を保持し、表示が巻き戻らないようにしなければならない（MUST）。

#### Scenario: Module directory exists
- **WHEN** the project is compiled
- **THEN** `src/tui/mod.rs` exists as the module entry point
- **AND** submodules are organized in `src/tui/*.rs` files

#### Scenario: Each submodule has single responsibility
- **GIVEN** the TUI module structure
- **THEN** `types.rs` contains only enum and type definitions
- **AND** `state.rs` contains only state management logic
- **AND** `events.rs` contains only event and command definitions
- **AND** `render.rs` contains only rendering functions
- **AND** `orchestrator.rs` contains only orchestration logic
- **AND** `runner.rs` contains only the main TUI loop
- **AND** `queue.rs` contains only DynamicQueue implementation
- **AND** `utils.rs` contains only utility functions

#### Scenario: Change progress uses shared state
- **GIVEN** the TUI state layer builds the change list for rendering
- **WHEN** change progress and execution metadata are required
- **THEN** the data source is the shared orchestration state
- **AND** UI-specific fields remain in TUI-owned state

#### Scenario: Iteration number does not regress during refresh
- **GIVEN** the TUI already displays `iteration_number=4` for a change
- **AND** the shared orchestration state reports `apply_count=3`
- **WHEN** the automatic refresh merges shared state into the TUI change list
- **THEN** the TUI keeps `iteration_number=4`

### Requirement: Public API Stability

The TUI module SHALL maintain its public exports.

However, adding new variants to `OrchestratorEvent` and `TuiCommand` MAY be allowed as part of feature additions within this project.

Existing variant semantics, fields, and names MUST remain compatible.

#### Scenario: New variants can be added without breaking existing ones
- **GIVEN** external code imports from the tui module
- **WHEN** new variants are added to `OrchestratorEvent` or `TuiCommand`
- **THEN** existing variants remain available and unchanged
- **AND** the module continues to compile and run within this repository

### Requirement: No Behavioral Changes

TUI refactoring SHALL NOT change runtime behavior.

Key input handling and TuiCommand processing in `run_tui_loop` MAY be split into helper functions for improved readability. However, existing shortcuts, display, and state transition behavior MUST be preserved.

#### Scenario: All existing tests pass

- **WHEN** `cargo test` is run after refactoring
- **THEN** all tests that passed before refactoring still pass
- **AND** no new test failures are introduced

#### Scenario: TUI functionality unchanged

- **GIVEN** the TUI is started with `cargo run -- tui`
- **WHEN** user interacts with the TUI
- **THEN** all keyboard shortcuts work as before
- **AND** all display elements render identically
- **AND** all state transitions behave identically

### Requirement: Dynamic Queue Management
The system SHALL provide the ability to dynamically add and remove changes to/from the queue during execution.

DynamicQueue SHALL support the following operations:
- `push(id)`: Add a change ID to the queue (with duplicate check)
- `pop()`: Retrieve the next change ID from the queue
- `remove(id)`: Remove a specified change ID from the queue

#### Scenario: Add to queue during execution
- **WHEN** the user selects a change with the Space key in Running mode
- **THEN** the change ID is added to DynamicQueue and will be executed in the next processing cycle

#### Scenario: Remove from queue during execution
- **WHEN** the user changes a [x] change to [@] with Space or @ key in Running mode
- **THEN** the corresponding change ID is removed from DynamicQueue and will not be executed

#### Scenario: Prevent duplicate additions
- **WHEN** attempting to add a change ID that already exists in the queue
- **THEN** the addition is rejected and the queue state remains unchanged

#### Scenario: Remove non-existent ID
- **WHEN** attempting to remove a change ID that does not exist in the queue
- **THEN** no error occurs and the queue state remains unchanged

### Requirement: Queue State Synchronization

The system SHALL always synchronize the queue state displayed in the UI with the DynamicQueue state.

`ResolveWait` is a state waiting for resolve completion, and Space/@ queue operations MUST NOT modify DynamicQueue. `MergeWait` similarly MUST NOT be a target for queue operations.

However, for `ResolveWait`/`MergeWait` rows, the following SHALL be satisfied:
- Space operation SHALL toggle only the execution mark (`selected`) and MUST NOT modify `queue_status` or DynamicQueue.
- @ operation SHALL toggle only the approval state (`is_approved`) and MUST NOT modify `queue_status` or DynamicQueue. If unapproval results in an unapproved state, `selected` MUST be cleared.

The TUI MUST display `ResolveWait` as `resolve wait` to clearly indicate it is not a target for queue operations.

#### Scenario: Remove from queue by unapprove
- **WHEN** the user unapproves a queued change with the @ key
- **THEN** the status changes to `QueueStatus::NotQueued` and is removed from DynamicQueue

#### Scenario: Remove from queue with Space key
- **WHEN** the user dequeues a [x] change with the Space key in Running mode
- **THEN** the status changes to `QueueStatus::NotQueued` and is removed from DynamicQueue

#### Scenario: Log removal operations
- **WHEN** a change is removed from DynamicQueue
- **THEN** the removal operation is logged

#### Scenario: Cannot change queue state during ResolveWait
- **GIVEN** the TUI is in running mode
- **AND** the cursor is on a change in `ResolveWait`
- **WHEN** the user presses Space or `@`
- **THEN** the change status SHALL remain `ResolveWait`
- **AND** DynamicQueue SHALL NOT be modified for the change
- **AND** Space operation toggles only the execution mark

#### Scenario: @ operation during ResolveWait changes only approval state
- **GIVEN** the TUI is in running mode
- **AND** the cursor is on a change in `ResolveWait`
- **WHEN** the user presses `@`
- **THEN** the change status SHALL remain `ResolveWait`
- **AND** DynamicQueue SHALL NOT be modified for the change
- **AND** only the approval state is toggled

#### Scenario: Cannot change queue state during MergeWait
- **GIVEN** the TUI is in running mode
- **AND** the cursor is on a change in `MergeWait`
- **WHEN** the user presses Space
- **THEN** the change status SHALL remain `MergeWait`
- **AND** DynamicQueue SHALL NOT be modified for the change
- **AND** Space operation toggles only the execution mark

#### Scenario: @ operation during MergeWait changes only approval state
- **GIVEN** the TUI is in running mode
- **AND** the cursor is on a change in `MergeWait`
- **WHEN** the user presses `@`
- **THEN** the change status SHALL remain `MergeWait`
- **AND** DynamicQueue SHALL NOT be modified for the change
- **AND** only the approval state is toggled

### Requirement: Event-Driven State Updates

The TUI MUST evaluate `MergeWait` in the 5-second auto-refresh and return it to `Queued` if any of the following conditions are met:

- The corresponding worktree does not exist
- The corresponding worktree exists and the worktree branch is not ahead of base

For auto-released changes that are no longer `MergeWait`, merge resolve operation hints and execution via `M` MUST NOT be performed.

Furthermore, changes that are serialized and in a waiting state for resolve SHALL be retained as `ResolveWait` and MUST NOT be returned to `NotQueued` by auto-refresh.

#### Scenario: Release MergeWait when worktree does not exist
- **GIVEN** a change is in `MergeWait`
- **AND** the corresponding worktree does not exist
- **WHEN** the 5-second polling auto-refresh is executed
- **THEN** the change status returns to `Queued`

#### Scenario: Release MergeWait for worktree with no commits ahead
- **GIVEN** a change is in `MergeWait`
- **AND** the corresponding worktree exists
- **AND** the worktree branch is not ahead of base
- **WHEN** the 5-second polling auto-refresh is executed
- **THEN** the change status returns to `Queued`

#### Scenario: Cannot use M for changes released from MergeWait
- **GIVEN** a change has returned from `MergeWait` to `Queued`
- **WHEN** the TUI key hints are rendered
- **THEN** the merge resolve hint via `M` is not displayed

#### Scenario: ResolveWait is retained during auto-refresh
- **GIVEN** a change is in `ResolveWait`
- **AND** resolve is in progress for another change
- **WHEN** the 5-second polling auto-refresh is executed
- **THEN** the change status remains `ResolveWait`

#### Scenario: Changes with WorkspaceState::Archived are identified as ResolveWait
- **GIVEN** a worktree exists and `detect_workspace_state` returns `WorkspaceState::Archived`
- **AND** the change is not merged (ahead of base)
- **WHEN** the TUI auto-refresh is executed
- **THEN** the change status is displayed as `ResolveWait`
- **AND** queue operations via Space/@ keys are not accepted

### Requirement: Log Entry Structure and Display

TUI log entries SHALL include timestamp, message, color, and optional context information (change ID, operation, iteration number).
Log headers are displayed progressively based on available context information.
At the start of apply/archive/acceptance/resolve, the corresponding subcommand string MUST be displayed in the TUI log.
Subcommand output logs MUST be recorded with the corresponding operation.

- Archive log output MUST always include the iteration number, and the log header MUST be displayed in the format `[{change_id}:archive:{iteration}]`.
- Analysis log output without a change_id MUST always include the iteration number, and the log header MUST be displayed in the format `[analysis:{iteration}]`.
- When auto-scroll is disabled, the TUI MUST preserve the log range the user is viewing, and displayed lines MUST NOT shift due to new log additions or log buffer trimming. If displayed lines are trimmed, they MUST be clamped to the oldest remaining log line, and auto-scroll MUST NOT be re-enabled automatically.

#### Scenario: apply/archive/acceptance/resolve commands are displayed
- **GIVEN** change_id is set and the start event for apply/archive/acceptance/resolve includes the command
- **WHEN** the TUI processes the start event
- **THEN** a `Command:` line is added to the log
- **AND** the log is recorded with the corresponding operation

#### Scenario: Archive logs are always displayed with iteration
- **GIVEN** a log entry is created with `change_id="test-change"`, `operation="archive"`, `iteration=2`
- **WHEN** the TUI renders the log
- **THEN** the log header is displayed as `[test-change:archive:2]`
- **AND** the retry order can be determined

#### Scenario: Analysis logs are displayed with iteration
- **GIVEN** a log entry is created with `change_id=None`, `operation="analysis"`, `iteration=3`
- **WHEN** the TUI renders the log
- **THEN** the log header is displayed as `[analysis:3]`
- **AND** re-execution of analysis can be distinguished

#### Scenario: Display is fixed when auto-scroll is disabled
- **GIVEN** the user has scrolled the log and auto-scroll is disabled
- **WHEN** new logs are added (and old logs are trimmed as needed)
- **THEN** the existing display range continues to point to the same log lines
- **AND** if the display range is trimmed, it is clamped to the oldest remaining log line
- **AND** auto-scroll is not automatically re-enabled

### Requirement: Reflect tasks.md progress in all states
The TUI MUST continue to display progress obtained from tasks.md even during archive/resolving. If reading tasks.md fails and returns 0/0, the previous progress MUST NOT be overwritten.
In auto-refresh processing, if 0/0 is returned from the active location, the archive location MUST be tried, and if still 0/0, the existing value MUST be retained.

#### Scenario: 0/0 is returned during Archive/Resolving
- **GIVEN** a change is in Archiving or Resolving state
- **AND** the previous progress is not 0/0
- **WHEN** auto-refresh fails to retrieve tasks.md and returns 0/0
- **THEN** the progress display retains the previous value

#### Scenario: Retain progress during auto-refresh immediately after archive move
- **GIVEN** a change is in Archiving state and tasks.md has been moved to the archive location on the worktree
- **AND** the previous progress is not 0/0
- **WHEN** auto-refresh returns 0/0 from `parse_change_with_worktree_fallback`
- **THEN** `parse_archived_change_with_worktree_fallback` is attempted
- **AND** if still 0/0, the existing progress value is retained
