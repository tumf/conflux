## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: no-delta-marker-validation

Strict validation MUST accept a change that has a `specs/.no-delta` marker file and no spec delta directories. The `.no-delta` file declares that the change intentionally carries no spec modifications.

#### Scenario: Change with .no-delta marker passes strict validation

**Given**: A change directory contains `specs/.no-delta` and no subdirectories under `specs/`
**When**: `cflx.py validate <id> --strict` is executed
**Then**: Validation passes without spec delta errors

#### Scenario: .no-delta marker conflicts with existing spec deltas

**Given**: A change directory contains both `specs/.no-delta` and one or more spec delta subdirectories under `specs/`
**When**: `cflx.py validate <id> --strict` is executed
**Then**: Validation fails with an error indicating `.no-delta` conflicts with existing spec deltas

#### Scenario: No .no-delta and no spec deltas fails strict validation

**Given**: A change directory has no `specs/.no-delta` file and no spec delta subdirectories under `specs/`
**When**: `cflx.py validate <id> --strict` is executed
**Then**: Validation fails with an error indicating no spec deltas found (unchanged from current behavior)
