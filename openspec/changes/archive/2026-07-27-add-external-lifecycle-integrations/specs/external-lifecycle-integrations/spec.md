## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: External lifecycle adapter configuration

Conflux MUST allow one optional external lifecycle adapter to be configured as a non-empty argv command. The adapter MUST be disabled by default, MUST inherit the cflx process environment, and MUST NOT require replacing or wrapping the `cflx` executable.

#### Scenario: Normal cflx invocation loads configured adapter

- **GIVEN** an external lifecycle adapter argv is configured
- **WHEN** the user runs bare `cflx`, `cflx tui`, or `cflx run` normally
- **THEN** Conflux starts the adapter as a child process
- **AND** the original cflx executable remains the foreground command

#### Scenario: Existing configuration remains compatible

- **GIVEN** no lifecycle adapter is configured
- **WHEN** Conflux loads configuration and runs
- **THEN** behavior is unchanged
- **AND** no adapter process is started

### Requirement: Versioned lifecycle event stream

Conflux MUST send newline-delimited JSON lifecycle messages to the adapter stdin. Every message MUST include a protocol version, monotonically increasing sequence number, event kind, and execution mode. The stream MUST represent process start, semantic state changes, optional session identity, and process stopping.

#### Scenario: TUI lifecycle is reported semantically

- **GIVEN** a configured adapter and an interactive local TUI
- **WHEN** the TUI moves through ready, running, confirmation, and stopping states
- **THEN** the adapter receives corresponding `idle`, `working`, `blocked`, and `working` semantic transitions
- **AND** duplicate unchanged states are not repeatedly emitted

#### Scenario: Non-interactive run lifecycle is reported

- **GIVEN** a configured adapter
- **WHEN** `cflx run` starts work and completes
- **THEN** the adapter receives process start, working lifecycle, and process stopping messages in order

### Requirement: Lifecycle integration is observability-only

External lifecycle adapters MUST NOT control workflow routing, acceptance, archive, merge, or resume decisions. Adapter spawn failures, write failures, early exits, malformed behavior, and backpressure MUST be isolated from cflx execution and reported only as bounded diagnostics.

#### Scenario: Adapter command is unavailable

- **GIVEN** the configured adapter executable does not exist
- **WHEN** cflx starts
- **THEN** cflx emits an actionable warning
- **AND** the requested TUI or run operation continues

#### Scenario: Adapter stops reading

- **GIVEN** the adapter child no longer consumes lifecycle messages
- **WHEN** Conflux continues producing state transitions and then exits
- **THEN** workflow execution is not blocked
- **AND** shutdown completes within the documented adapter deadline

### Requirement: Lifecycle payload privacy

Lifecycle messages MUST NOT include environment values, credentials, provider tokens, prompts, terminal screen contents, or unrestricted error bodies by default. Context fields MUST be explicitly defined and limited to information required to identify the cflx process and public workflow phase.

#### Scenario: Adapter receives privacy-safe payload

- **GIVEN** the cflx environment and configuration contain secrets
- **WHEN** lifecycle events are serialized
- **THEN** serialized JSON contains no secret values or complete environment/configuration dump
- **AND** tests verify the allowed payload fields

### Requirement: Typed frontend lifecycle emission

TUI and non-interactive frontends MUST publish lifecycle state from typed runtime state and actions rather than rendered-screen scraping. This lifecycle publication MUST preserve the existing `EventSink` and `ReducerCommand` ownership boundaries.

#### Scenario: Confirmation dialog reports blocked

- **GIVEN** the TUI enters a confirmation or retry interaction requiring user input
- **WHEN** the typed TUI state changes
- **THEN** the lifecycle dispatcher receives `blocked`
- **AND** no terminal buffer parsing is used

#### Scenario: Adapter cannot mutate core state

- **GIVEN** an external lifecycle adapter is active
- **WHEN** it receives events or exits with an error
- **THEN** Core state changes still occur only through existing Core command paths
- **AND** adapter behavior cannot select the next workflow action
