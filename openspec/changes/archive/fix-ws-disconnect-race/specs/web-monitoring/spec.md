## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Dashboard UI - Real-time Updates
The web dashboard SHALL automatically update when orchestrator state changes.
The web dashboard SHALL render a fresh initial state snapshot on page load.
The web dashboard SHALL fall back to polling when WebSocket updates are unavailable.

#### Scenario: Initial state render
- **WHEN** dashboard loads
- **THEN** JavaScript fetches the current state from `/api/state`
- **AND** the fetch disables caching (equivalent to `Cache-Control: no-store` semantics)
- **AND** dashboard renders progress and task counts from the fetched snapshot

#### Scenario: WebSocket connection in dashboard
- **WHEN** dashboard loads
- **THEN** JavaScript establishes WebSocket connection to `/ws`
- **AND** connection status indicator shows "Connected"

#### Scenario: Live progress updates
- **WHEN** orchestrator completes a task
- **THEN** WebSocket broadcast is received
- **AND** dashboard updates progress bar without page reload
- **AND** task count updates reflect new state

#### Scenario: WebSocket reconnection
- **WHEN** WebSocket connection is lost
- **THEN** dashboard shows "Disconnected" status
- **AND** JavaScript automatically attempts to reconnect
- **AND** reconnection succeeds when server is available

#### Scenario: Polling fallback updates
- **WHEN** WebSocket is disconnected and reconnection has not succeeded
- **THEN** dashboard falls back to polling `/api/state` at regular intervals

#### Scenario: Disconnect during CONNECTING state
- **GIVEN** WebSocket connection is in CONNECTING state (readyState === 0)
- **WHEN** disconnect is called before the connection is established
- **THEN** the WebSocket SHALL NOT produce a "closed before established" browser warning
- **AND** the connection SHALL be closed cleanly after the open event fires or abandoned without error
- **AND** no reconnection attempt SHALL be triggered by the disconnect call
