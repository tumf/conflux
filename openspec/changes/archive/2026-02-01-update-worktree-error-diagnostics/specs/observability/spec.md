## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: REQ-OBS-004 Error Messages with Context

The orchestrator MUST ensure error messages include actionable context information to aid troubleshooting and debugging.

Context information MUST include:
- Operation type (e.g., apply, archive, resolve, analyze)
- Change ID (when the error is related to a specific change)
- Workspace path or working directory (when available and relevant)
- Failure reason or error details (when available)
- 実行コマンド（program + args、利用可能な場合）
- stderr/stdout（取得できた場合）

#### Scenario: Apply Operation Failure with Context

- **GIVEN** an apply operation fails for change `alpha`
- **WHEN** the orchestrator records the error
- **THEN** the error message includes the operation type (`apply`)
- **AND** the error message includes the change ID (`alpha`)
- **AND** the error message includes the workspace or working directory when available

#### Scenario: Cancelled Operation with Context

- **GIVEN** an archive operation is cancelled for change `beta`
- **WHEN** the cancellation is logged
- **THEN** the error message includes "Cancelled archive for 'beta'"
- **AND** the message includes the workspace path if applicable

#### Scenario: Internal Error with Command Context

- **GIVEN** stdout/stderr capture fails during command execution
- **WHEN** the internal error is recorded
- **THEN** the error message includes the command that was being executed
- **AND** the error message includes the working directory where the command was running

#### Scenario: VCS command failure includes stderr and command

- **GIVEN** a VCS command fails with stderr output
- **WHEN** the orchestrator records the error
- **THEN** the error message includes the full command (program + args)
- **AND** the error message includes the working directory when available
- **AND** the error message includes the captured stderr (and stdout if available)

#### Scenario: TUI and Log Message Consistency

- **GIVEN** a parallel execution error is encountered
- **WHEN** the error is displayed in both TUI and log files
- **THEN** the TUI event message and the log message contain identical context information
- **AND** both include the operation type, change ID, and workspace path
