## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Mode-aware mark and queue behavior

The service MUST allow execution-mark mutation in Select and Stopped modes, resolve accepted marks into initial targets at Start, use reducer queue intent for ordinary Running additions, allow mark-only mutation for MergeWait and ResolveWait, and reject mark mutation in Error mode. Queue removal and successful stop-and-dequeue MUST revoke ordinary execution eligibility until explicit requeue or retry. Catalog refresh or eligibility re-evaluation MUST classify one coherent state, clear marks and queue presentation for changes that became ineligible, and report stable exclusion reasons. Bulk execution-mark mutation MUST choose one target state from eligible rows only and update eligible marks plus Running queue intent atomically.

#### Scenario: Eligibility refresh cleans invalid intent

**Given**: Marked or queued changes become ineligible under current repository and worktree evidence
**When**: The operator service applies catalog refresh or eligibility re-evaluation
**Then**: It clears those execution marks and queue presentation atomically
**And**: The outcome identifies each excluded change and reason

#### Scenario: Bulk mark updates one coherent target set

**Given**: Eligible and excluded changes exist in one admitted state
**When**: The operator requests bulk execution-mark mutation
**Then**: The service derives one target mark from eligible changes only
**And**: It updates eligible marks and Running queue intent atomically
**And**: Excluded changes retain coherent intent and receive stable reasons
