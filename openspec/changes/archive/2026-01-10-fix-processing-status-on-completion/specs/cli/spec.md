# CLI Spec Delta: Fix Processing Status on Task Completion

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: TUI Status Transition on Apply Completion

The TUI SHALL transition change status from `Processing` to `Completed` when an apply operation succeeds and all tasks are complete.

#### Scenario: Apply succeeds with 100% task completion

- **GIVEN** a change is being processed in running mode
- **AND** the change has `Processing` status
- **WHEN** the apply command completes successfully
- **AND** all tasks for the change are marked complete (100%)
- **THEN** the change status transitions to `Completed`
- **AND** the status display shows `[completed]` instead of spinner
- **AND** a log entry "Completed: <change-id>" is added

#### Scenario: Apply succeeds with incomplete tasks

- **GIVEN** a change is being processed in running mode
- **AND** the change has `Processing` status
- **WHEN** the apply command completes successfully
- **AND** some tasks remain incomplete (< 100%)
- **THEN** the change status remains `Processing`
- **AND** the orchestrator continues to next apply iteration

#### Scenario: 100% complete change displays correctly before archive

- **GIVEN** a change has completed all tasks (100%)
- **AND** the change has `Completed` status
- **WHEN** the TUI renders the change list
- **THEN** the status shows `[completed]` (not `Processing...` with 100%)
- **AND** the progress column shows the task count (e.g., `29/29`)

### Requirement: Archive Phase Does Not Reset Status

The TUI archive phase SHALL NOT send redundant status transition events for changes that are already in `Completed` status.

#### Scenario: Archive already-completed change

- **GIVEN** a change has `Completed` status
- **WHEN** the archive phase processes the change
- **THEN** no `ProcessingStarted` event is sent
- **AND** no additional `ProcessingCompleted` event is sent
- **AND** only `ChangeArchived` event is sent upon successful archive

#### Scenario: Archive pre-complete change from queue

- **GIVEN** a change was 100% complete before being queued
- **AND** the change has `Queued` status (not yet processed)
- **WHEN** the archive phase identifies the change as complete
- **THEN** `ProcessingStarted` event is sent (status → Processing)
- **AND** `ProcessingCompleted` event is sent (status → Completed)
- **AND** archive command is executed
- **AND** `ChangeArchived` event is sent (status → Archived)
