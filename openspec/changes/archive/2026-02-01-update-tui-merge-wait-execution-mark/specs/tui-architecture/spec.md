## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Queue State Synchronization

The system SHALL always synchronize the queue state displayed in the UI with the DynamicQueue state.

`ResolveWait` is a state waiting for resolve completion, and Space/@ queue operations MUST NOT modify DynamicQueue. `MergeWait` similarly MUST NOT be a target for queue operations.

However, for `ResolveWait`/`MergeWait` rows, the following SHALL be satisfied:
- Space operation SHALL toggle only the execution mark (`selected`) and MUST NOT modify `queue_status` or DynamicQueue.
- @ operation SHALL toggle only the approval state (`is_approved`) and MUST NOT modify `queue_status` or DynamicQueue. If unapproval results in an unapproved state, `selected` MUST be cleared.

The TUI MUST display `ResolveWait` as `resolve wait` to clearly indicate it is not a target for queue operations.

#### Scenario: Remove from queue by unapprove
- **WHEN** the user unapproves a queued change with the @ key
- **THEN** the status changes to `QueueStatus::NotQueued` and is removed from DynamicQueue

#### Scenario: Remove from queue with Space key
- **WHEN** the user dequeues a [x] change with the Space key in Running mode
- **THEN** the status changes to `QueueStatus::NotQueued` and is removed from DynamicQueue

#### Scenario: Log removal operations
- **WHEN** a change is removed from DynamicQueue
- **THEN** the removal operation is logged

#### Scenario: Cannot change queue state during ResolveWait
- **GIVEN** the TUI is in running mode
- **AND** the cursor is on a change in `ResolveWait`
- **WHEN** the user presses Space or `@`
- **THEN** the change status SHALL remain `ResolveWait`
- **AND** DynamicQueue SHALL NOT be modified for the change
- **AND** Space operation toggles only the execution mark

#### Scenario: @ operation during ResolveWait changes only approval state
- **GIVEN** the TUI is in running mode
- **AND** the cursor is on a change in `ResolveWait`
- **WHEN** the user presses `@`
- **THEN** the change status SHALL remain `ResolveWait`
- **AND** DynamicQueue SHALL NOT be modified for the change
- **AND** only the approval state is toggled

#### Scenario: Cannot change queue state during MergeWait
- **GIVEN** the TUI is in running mode
- **AND** the cursor is on a change in `MergeWait`
- **WHEN** the user presses Space
- **THEN** the change status SHALL remain `MergeWait`
- **AND** DynamicQueue SHALL NOT be modified for the change
- **AND** Space operation toggles only the execution mark

#### Scenario: @ operation during MergeWait changes only approval state
- **GIVEN** the TUI is in running mode
- **AND** the cursor is on a change in `MergeWait`
- **WHEN** the user presses `@`
- **THEN** the change status SHALL remain `MergeWait`
- **AND** DynamicQueue SHALL NOT be modified for the change
- **AND** only the approval state is toggled

### Requirement: Event-Driven State Updates

The TUI MUST evaluate `MergeWait` in the 5-second auto-refresh and return it to `Queued` if any of the following conditions are met:

- The corresponding worktree does not exist
- The corresponding worktree exists and the worktree branch is not ahead of base

For auto-released changes that are no longer `MergeWait`, merge resolve operation hints and execution via `M` MUST NOT be performed.

Furthermore, changes that are serialized and in a waiting state for resolve SHALL be retained as `ResolveWait` and MUST NOT be returned to `NotQueued` by auto-refresh.

#### Scenario: Release MergeWait when worktree does not exist
- **GIVEN** a change is in `MergeWait`
- **AND** the corresponding worktree does not exist
- **WHEN** the 5-second polling auto-refresh is executed
- **THEN** the change status returns to `Queued`

#### Scenario: Release MergeWait for worktree with no commits ahead
- **GIVEN** a change is in `MergeWait`
- **AND** the corresponding worktree exists
- **AND** the worktree branch is not ahead of base
- **WHEN** the 5-second polling auto-refresh is executed
- **THEN** the change status returns to `Queued`

#### Scenario: Cannot use M for changes released from MergeWait
- **GIVEN** a change has returned from `MergeWait` to `Queued`
- **WHEN** the TUI key hints are rendered
- **THEN** the merge resolve hint via `M` is not displayed

#### Scenario: ResolveWait is retained during auto-refresh
- **GIVEN** a change is in `ResolveWait`
- **AND** resolve is in progress for another change
- **WHEN** the 5-second polling auto-refresh is executed
- **THEN** the change status remains `ResolveWait`

#### Scenario: Changes with WorkspaceState::Archived are identified as ResolveWait
- **GIVEN** a worktree exists and `detect_workspace_state` returns `WorkspaceState::Archived`
- **AND** the change is not merged (ahead of base)
- **WHEN** the TUI auto-refresh is executed
- **THEN** the change status is displayed as `ResolveWait`
- **AND** queue operations via Space/@ keys are not accepted
