## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: TUI rejected row is visible but not selectable

When a change directory contains both `openspec/changes/<change_id>/proposal.md` and `openspec/changes/<change_id>/REJECTED.md`, the TUI change list SHALL display that change as a read-only `rejected` row rather than omitting it entirely.

A rejected row SHALL NOT participate in execution mark, queue, resume, or new-change affordances. The TUI MUST keep its frontend-visible execution mark cleared (`selected = false`), MUST ignore queue-oriented key operations for that row, and MUST NOT label the row with the `NEW` badge or count it toward `new_change_count`.

#### Scenario: Rejected change is shown in TUI list

- **GIVEN** `openspec/changes/fix-auth/proposal.md` exists
- **AND** `openspec/changes/fix-auth/REJECTED.md` exists
- **WHEN** the TUI refreshes its change list
- **THEN** `fix-auth` is displayed in the list
- **AND** its display status is `rejected`

#### Scenario: Rejected row cannot gain an execution mark

- **GIVEN** `fix-auth` is displayed as a `rejected` row in the TUI
- **WHEN** the user presses Space on that row
- **THEN** the row remains `selected = false`
- **AND** no x mark is shown for `fix-auth`
- **AND** the display status remains `rejected`

#### Scenario: Rejected row is ignored by queue-oriented actions

- **GIVEN** `fix-auth` is displayed as a `rejected` row in the TUI
- **WHEN** the user invokes queue or resume-oriented actions such as `@` or `F5`
- **THEN** `fix-auth` is not added to the execution queue
- **AND** no execution start is requested for `fix-auth`

#### Scenario: Rejected row is not marked as NEW on refresh

- **GIVEN** `fix-auth` is not yet present in the current TUI list
- **AND** `openspec/changes/fix-auth/proposal.md` exists
- **AND** `openspec/changes/fix-auth/REJECTED.md` exists
- **WHEN** the next TUI refresh adds `fix-auth` as a rejected row
- **THEN** `fix-auth` is displayed as `rejected`
- **AND** the row does NOT show the `NEW` badge
- **AND** `new_change_count` does NOT increase because of `fix-auth`

#### Scenario: Marker removal reactivates the change as unselected active row

- **GIVEN** `fix-auth` was previously shown as a `rejected` row
- **AND** the user removes `openspec/changes/fix-auth/REJECTED.md` from the base branch
- **WHEN** the TUI refreshes after `fix-auth` reappears in the active listing
- **THEN** `fix-auth` is shown as `not queued`
- **AND** `fix-auth` remains `selected = false` until explicitly marked again
